# About Startups
Revenue is job one. Revenue goes first or the company is gone.  
_Fast_ serves __new contract__ revenue.  
> "After we deliver on the contract and get paid, we can put in 
> the logging we know we'll need, 
> work on the performance, 
> write the documentation...."  

Service companies stay there, _Fast_ with new contracts as king.  

Product companies have to _transition_.  
__Monthly Recurring Revenue__ (MRR) starts to challenge new contracts for priority, revenue is more secure, which leads to growth, hiring, and support.  

What's to _transition_?  
Growth weighs down _fast_ code requiring performance work, maybe new architecture.  
Hiring requires training, sharing knowledge, meetings.  
Support of MRR needs prevention, stability, testing, monitoring, coordination.  

The transition to growth, from _Services_ to _Product_, is about tackling the balance between _fast_ and _scale_, between *writing* software and *supporting* software. This website is dedicated to that balance, fast *enough* and scalable *enough* on the way through 10x growth to 1,000,000x growth.
