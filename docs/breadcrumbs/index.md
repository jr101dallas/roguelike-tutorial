# Plan
Pulling together breadcrumbs blathered about in the blog and other places.

## Skip
SadConsole and display and look  
GoRogue and location and proximity  

### Targets
1. combat interaction (when to attack can be filled in when proximity exists)  
1. inventory (for now I won't "show" wearing armor in the display)  
1. dialog (again, proximity later)  
1. shopping (proximity later)  
1. enemies and merchants to fight and bargain with  

#### Architecture Notes
* aim to deliver value, user functionality, admin functionality, think customers  
* little bites, micro stories  
* C#, mstest  
* .NET core .dlls where possible, command line to start  
* test projects for each code project  
* planning to wrap libraries in a separate project in order to keep my architecture clean, the wrapper may be ugly as a result
