# roguelike-tutorial
This is a project, a tutorial, focused on practices that allow long term momentum in a project. Many tutorials will show a focused lesson on a technology, or a library, or a language. This one does not. This one is about processes. The point, if I can manage it, is to demonstrate an algorithm that maximizes capture of progress, minimizes loss of time, maximizes clarity of purpose in code, and minimizes training time on a complex codebase. In short, an algorithm for coding a project around which you hope to build a business.  

## GitHub Project Pages
This repository is configured as a GitHub Project Pages site at https://assumeforsimplicity.com/roguelike-tutorial and the sourcecode for the site is located in the ```/docs``` folder on the ```main``` branch.  

## Solution File
This is a C# project, except for the website part, and the solution file is at the root of the repository along with the README.md file. Sooner or later ther will be enough to the solution that the README.md will help with setting up and dealing with the website and local Jekyll build and testing.
